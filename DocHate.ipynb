    "\n",
    "The folks at ProPublica’s Documenting Hate project had this problem, with around 6,000 tips about hate crimes and bias incidents contributed by readers. To report a hate incident, someone only has to provide a written description of what happened. If they choose, they can also fill out checkboxes for why the victim was targeted -- e.g. because of their race, religion or immigrant status.\n",

    "## Step 3. Cleaning the data to remove the things that might confuse a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is one of the most important parts of real-world natural language processing, but it's underdiscussed for at least two reasons: it's completely unsexy and it's often different for every project. Data cleaning means removing stuff that might distract a computer and combining similar but not quite identical features so that they appear identical to the computer. A good way to think about data cleaning is to ask yourself what sorts of things in your data would be what _you_ would use to categorize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy example is that we lowercase everything (in other words, making the not-quite-identical words \"Then\" and \"then\" identical by transforming the first to \"then\"), since we're working with text typed by internet users. And, we will remove punctuation and \"non-word characters\" because they're not likely to tell us much about what attribute a hate crime was targeted by. (Ask yourself, will commas tell us anything about hate crimes? Of course not.) These are very typical and built into the vectorizers... (so we don't have to do it). We may also want to remove common English words like \"a\" and \"the\" -- typically called \"stopwords\" -- this is sometimes automatic, but not always, so it's worth checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples depend on your precise dataset. There's no recipe. You have to ask yourself what words will be a distraction to the model. Here's a harder example: Consider a database of press releases from US Congress that you're trying to categorize by topic (taxation, military, education, etc.). The model should pick out the phrases used frequently by members of Congress who talk about each topic a lot. Sometimes that's good (\"deduction\", for instance)... but sometimes that's bad, like the name of former Rep. Paul Ryan's press secretary. Those words aren't actually useful for determining if something is about taxation... especially if Ryan's replacement hires his staffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is the process of cogitating about the data and figuring out a way to remove the unhelpful stuff, but not the helpful stuff. This is task-specific; if we had a dataset of press releases about Wisconsin that contained Ryan's press releases but also ones from the Milwaukee Brewers that we were trying to classify into the politics or sports category, the presence of Ryan-related words like the name of his press secretary _would_ be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since the Documenting Hate tip data was submitted by users, it’s possible that they made mistakes -- like marking a clearly religion-related hate crime as related to, say, gender. Or failing to select ‘immigrant’ as a category for an incident that involved the intersection of race and immigrant status. Once I had an initial model trained, I dug -- quite unscientifically -- through the data that the classifier gets wrong to see if there are some where the user-contributed answer (that we treat as ground-truth) might be wrong. We might want to change some of the answers ourselves or even merge categories. You don’t want the computer to “learn” someone else’s mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see what words are being fed into the Naive Bayes model with `vectorizer.vocabulary_.keys()`. Let's do that and take a look. They mostly look good, right? "

This tactic is often successful, but it gave worse results here.\n",

If the model has generalized, it's learned what _really_ distinguishes religion-related tips.

To do that, we force the model to ignore some things with a \"dropout layer\".
